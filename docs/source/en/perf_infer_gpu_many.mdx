# Efficient Inference on a Multiple GPUs

This document contains information on how to efficiently infer on a multiple GPUs. 

Make sure to first read on the [inference on a single GPU](perf_infer_cpu) as most of the techniques listed there would benefit the multi-gpu set up as well.

<Tip>

 Note: A multi GPU setup can use the majority of the strategies described in the [single GPU section](perf infer gpu one). You must be aware of simple techniques, though, that can be used for a better usage.

## `bitsandbytes` integration for Int8 mixed-precision matrix decomposition - multi GPU setup

Note that this features is also totally applicable in a single GPU setup as well - Check out the [single GPU section](perf_infer_gpu_one) for more details about the paper.

Note, that you would require a GPU to run mixed-8bit models as the kernels have been compiled for GPUs only. Make sure that you have enough GPU memory to store the quarter (or half if your model weights are in half precision) of the model before using this feature. 
Below are some notes to help you use this module, or follow the demos on [Google colab](#colab-demos).

### Requirements

- Make sure you run that on NVIDIA GPUs that support 8-bit tensor cores (Turing, Ampere or newer architectures - e.g. T4, RTX20s RTX30s, A40-A100).
- Install the correct version of `bitsandbytes` by running:
`pip install bitsandbytes>=0.31.5`
- Install `accelerate`
`pip install accelerate>=0.12.0`

### Running mixed-int8 models - multi GPU setup

After installing the required libraries, the way to load your mixed 8-bit model in multiple GPUs is as follows (same command as single GPU setup):
```py
model_name = "bigscience/bloom-2b5"
model_8bit = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, device_map="auto", load_in_8bit=True)
```
You can control the GPU RAM you want to allocate on each GPU using `accelerate`. Use the `max_memory` argument as follows:

```py
max_memory_mapping = {0: "1GB", 1: "2GB"}
model_name = "bigscience/bloom-3b"
model_8bit = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name, device_map="auto", load_in_8bit=True, max_memory=max_memory_mapping
)
```
In this example, the first GPU will use 1GB of memory and the second 2GB.
